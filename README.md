# Real-Time-Bluetooth-Networks-Shape-The-World  
Lab work done to complete the UTAustinX class [Real-Time Bluetooth Networks-Shape the World](https://www.edx.org/course/real-time-bluetooth-networks-shape-the-world?index=undefined) is contained within this repository.  
## [Lab 1: Introduction to I/O](https://github.com/jeff-daniels/UTAustinX-Real-Time-Bluetooth-Networks-Shape-The-World/blob/main/Lab%201%20Introduction%20to%20IO/Lab1.c)    
The Lab 1 starter project using the LaunchPad and the Educational BoosterPack MK-II (BOOSTXL-EDUMKII) is a fitness device. It inputs from the microphone, accelerometer, light sensor and buttons. It performs some simple measurements and calculations of steps, sound intensity, and light intensity. It outputs data to the LCD and it generates simple beeping sounds. Figure Lab1.1 shows the data flow graph of Lab 1. Your assignment in Lab 1 is to increase the rate of Task0 from 10 to 1000 Hz.
